# Vampire Village React App

This React application is a multiplayer game called Vampire Village, where players take on the roles of villagers and vampires in a battle of wits and deduction.

## Day Phase Instructions:

- During the day phase, all players gather in the village square to discuss and deliberate.
- Villagers should share any suspicions they have about other players and present evidence if available.
- Players can ask questions, analyze behavior, and attempt to deduce the identities of vampires.
- The goal for villagers is to identify and vote out suspected vampires.
- Players must be cautious not to reveal sensitive information that could be used by vampires against them.
- Once all discussions are complete, players vote on which player they believe is a vampire.
- The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game and their role is revealed.
- After the vote, the game progresses to the night phase.

## Night Phase Instructions:

- During the night phase, vampires secretly select a player to eliminate.
- Villagers must try to protect themselves from vampire attacks.
- Special roles like the Seer may have additional actions they can perform during the night.
- Once all actions are resolved, the day phase begins again.
